This repository is the collection of symbols from a wide array of sources and areas of interest including but not limited to:
- Computing
- Gaming
- Art
- Web Design
- Others

These symbols are what I use and have used for many years as I have built this collection so that I no longer had to regather resources each time. I have used these for
website building/design, for use in creating backgrounds for Stream Deck buttons, for use in laser cutting and other forms of art and many others. I do not own, nor claim
to own, any of the symbols or art that appears in this repository. Most/many of the symbols are exceptionally common in their respective areas of use and I frequently add
more as I go. Most of the symbols have had their backgrounds stripped and replaced with a transparent alternative and various gradient/color variants exist for many of the
options created by me using the gradient symbol in GIMP.

This is an ongoing project and symbols may be reorganized, added, or subtracted as I go. If you are interested in a special request not found here feel free to ask.
